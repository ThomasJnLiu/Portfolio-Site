Other technical specifications\r\n        included being able to add and remove movies from the nomination list, disabling nomination buttons of already nominated movies, as well as \r\n        letting the user know when they've nominated 5 movies.`,\r\n      `I began by drafting designs for web user interface in Figma. I wanted to make the link to Shopify's brand obvious, so the colour green was \r\n        chosen as a secondary colour. To further reinforce the link to Shopify, I created a quick mockup of a movie-based Shopify logo in Photoshop.`,\r\n      `I heavily referenced Google's Material Design guidelines while brainstorming, and eventually settled on a card-based method for displaying the movie results.\r\n        I decided to divide the main content of the page between the movies grid and the nominations panel, the latter of which would follow the user\r\n        as they scrolled through the page. Users would click on the green button below each movie to nominate it, and it be added to the \r\n        nominations panel on the right. By taking these steps, I ensured the finalized design would be visually sharp and easy to navigate.`,\r\n      `In order to make the design responsive, I also planned for a mobile variant of the user interface. Many elements that were previously side-by-side, such as the\r\n        nominations panel and movie cards, were rearranged on top of each other to account for the decrease in horizontal space.`,\r\n      `Before coding any components, I made a basic search box to communicate with the OMDB API using the Axios client, to make sure I could submit queries and receive\r\n        information correctly. After I confirmed the API was being called correctly, I moved to implementing the user interface in React. While using Figma, I intentionally made self-contained\r\n        elements with clear boundaries so they would be easy to code, such as the nominations box, the movie cards, and header. Once the components and \r\n        functionality were in place, I styled the app using CSS and added media queries to ensure a responsive design.`,\r\n      `Before finishing my project, I made some minor touch-ups and included a link to the repo in the header, a pop-up\r\n        when the user submits their nominations, and a favicon. The nominations panel was also aligned to the left to occupy the empty space before the user\r\n        has made a search.`,\r\n      `The final project can be accessed at: https://thomasjnliu.github.io/Shopify-Design-Challenge-2021/ `,\r\n    ],\r\n    headerImg: \"/img/shopify-design-challenge/shopify-header2.png\",\r\n    img: [\r\n      \"\",\r\n      \"/img/shopify-design-challenge/logo.png\",\r\n      \"/img/shopify-design-challenge/shopify-figma.png\",\r\n      \"/img/shopify-design-challenge/shopify-figma2.png\",\r\n      \"/img/shopify-design-challenge/shopify2.png\",\r\n      \"/img/shopify-design-challenge/shopify3.png\",\r\n    ],\r\n    heading: [\r\n      \"Overview\",\r\n      \"First Steps\",\r\n      \"Using Material Design\",\r\n      \"Planning a Responsive UI\",\r\n      \"From Figma to React\",\r\n      \"Finishing Touches\",\r\n      \"Final Product\",\r\n    ],\r\n    layout: [\"2\", \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"3\", \"2\"],\r\n  },\r\n  // {\r\n  //   name: \"Online Course Exam Page Redesign\",\r\n  //   title: \"Online Course Exam Page Redesign\",\r\n  //   description:\r\n  //     \"A redesign on old UI buttons made for Ontario Power Generation's e-learning framework.\",\r\n  //   sideInfo: [\r\n  //     \"YEAR: 2020\",\r\n  //     \"TOOLS USED: Photoshop, Illustrator, JavaScript, HTML, CSS\",\r\n  //   ],\r\n\r\n  //   content: [\r\n  //     `During my internship at Ontario Power Generation, I was tasked with updating their e-learning\r\n  //     framework's user interface buttons to increase accessibility by making them\r\n  //     complaint for users with colour disabilities.`,\r\n  //     `The major problem with the previous buttons (seen right) was that they failed to meet the colour contrast standards\r\n  //     set by the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA).
