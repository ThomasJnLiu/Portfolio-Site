In addition, I was also requested to redesign\n      the appearance of the new buttons to be more modern.","In my first revision of the icons, I moved towards simplifying the forms of the icons. \n        I also got rid of unnecessary extra colours in the design, as seen in the objectives and the glossary icon. While this revision\n        was a step in the right direction to making the icons look sharper, I was unhappy with the colours chosen, as the harsh\n        orange-red used for the hover state and dark blue was a drastic change from the original colours.","As a result, many of the variations made afterwards were explorations in what colours would work.\n        I experimented with brighter variations of the old icons, as well as outlined versions, and even flat-vector drawings.\n        Throughout all these variants, the geometry and shape of the icons remained consistent.","In the final icons, the orange hover state was darkened to create more contrast when compared to the blue used for the active\n       state. In addition, the geometry of the icons were reduced to simple shapes, as seen in the print icon. A subtle dark outline was\n       also added around the active states. Both of these changes helped the icons to be more legible, sharper, and easy to recognize.","Throughout the process, I made sure to test the icons in the e-learning framework to look at them within the context of their use.\n        I was given access to the framework's development server, where I used HTML, CSS, and JS to replace the old icons, as well as\n        create pages specifically for testing them out.
